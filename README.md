# UCSPowerCLI

This is a compilation of UCS Power CLI, and was taken from different resources.  The scripts here are taken from 
https://www.timcarman.net/as-built-report/
and https://community.cisco.com/t5/unified-computing-system/ucs-healthcheck-v2-5/ta-p/3654629

The colors have been modified to meet C1 color schemes, and the UCS Power Tool module nomenclature has been changed to meet the latest
UCS PowerTools module names.
